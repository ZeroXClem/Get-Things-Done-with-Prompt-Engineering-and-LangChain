Here is a Mermaid diagram for a decentralized access control system based on your prompt:

```

Key entities and roles:
- DAO Members: Participate in governance and elect Contract Admins
- Contract Admins: Set and manage access control permissions
- End Users: Request access to the system
- Trusted Third Parties: Can be delegated permissions by the Access Control Contract

Access control mechanisms:
- Permission levels set by Contract Admins via the Access Control Contract
- Delegation of permissions to Trusted Third Parties
- Emergency Override through multi-sig approval for temporary access

Decision points and potential failure scenarios:
- User Requests Access: Permissions checked by Access Control Contract
  - If permitted, access is granted
  - If not permitted, access is denied
- Emergency Override: Requires multi-sig approval
  - If approved, temporary access is granted
  - If rejected, override is denied

DAO Governance processes:
- DAO Members submit proposals
- Proposals are voted on
  - If approved, permissions are updated in the Access Control Contract
  - If rejected, the proposal is discarded

Security considerations:
- Potential Attack Vectors can exploit User Access Requests
- Security Measures mitigate threats and monitor access requests
- The Access Control Contract is secured by these measures

The diagram emphasizes the key decision points, governance processes, and security considerations in a visually clear manner for easy understanding by security reviewers. The system's resilience against potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors is highlighted.
